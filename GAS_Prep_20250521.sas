 * Author:        Mikhail Hoskins
 * Date Created:  05/14/2025
 * Date Modified: 05/14/2025
 * Description:   We want to evaluate GAS over the last decade + in NC. Recent study showed an increase year over year, can we replicate for NC.
 *				  (https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2831512#)
 *
 * Inputs:       case.sas7bdat , case_phi.sas7bdat , Admin_question_package_addl.sas7bdat : Z:\YYYYMMDD , risk factors from NCEDSS
 * Output:       .
 * Notes:        Program pulls GAS. 
 *				 Annotations are between /* to help guide. If the code doesn't work or numbers don't align, check here: 
 *				 https://github.com/NC-DPH/Communicable-Disease-Dashboards/blob/main/NCD3v2%20In%20Progress.sas
 *					Split prior code into a "prep" step and then the analysis step in the original program.
